# Happy Thoughts


This weeks assignment was also a React project where we was to build a Technigo "twitter" to post our happy thougts. With the help of Technigos 'happy thoughts' API we practice to both send and recive data from the API and firing requests within useEffect.


## The problem

I really liked this weeks project! It was fun to see the other students posts in the chat, it made the project in a way feels like a group project, something we built together eventhough it was a 'single' project. For me it was really good that the lessons this week were structured in a way that made it possible to code along while building the project. For me it was good to be abel to stop the recorded video and reflect over what I had written in my code. That gave me a greater understanding and also the currage to try out more with my code by myself because i knew that i could always go back to the recorded video and fix it if something went wrong. It really reduced a lots of stress for me! And i could focus more on learning/reflecting instead of just complete the task. 
Im really happy with my project this week, I hade fun building it and i´m proud that I did one of the red level requirements.
