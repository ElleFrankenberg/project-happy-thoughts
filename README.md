I downloded a font, but i culdent seam to get in to work. this week was the lessons really good to have the abillity to code along stop the video end reflect about what i was doing. It feels this week is the first week that i understood what i was doing. wich tog bort much stress and i could focus mor on the assinment and try to do be a bit more ruteless wiht my code because i know that i could alwas go back to the video end rewach. i learnt the hard way to really read the assignment, if i would have done that and rememeberd that i was sofossed to write min 5 caracters it woult have speard me on half day of trying to figure out way my tre caracter word woulden show. in safari the heart in the like button is not in the center, i think styling is a bit tricky. but funn to have a design to g√• efter och try to efterlikna.
